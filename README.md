# IoT-Based-Motion-Detection-and-Security-Alert-System
Developed an IoT-based security system that detects motion using a connected sensor and captures video footage when motion is detected. The system automatically sends an email with an image and video of the detected motion as an alert. The project utilizes Python, OpenCV for video capture, serial communication for sensor integration, and SMTP for email notifications.

When motion is detected, the system captures an image using the webcam, saves it, and sends it to a specified email address along with a short video of the event. The system continuously monitors the sensor and provides real-time security alerts, making it suitable for home and office security.
